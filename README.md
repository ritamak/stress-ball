## Description
The idea beind STRESS BALL is to have a ball moving around and the user as to click in the ball every time it appears in random different places. The ball appears every x seconds I the first level and the seconds decrease in the next level and so on. If the user fails to click inside the ball, the user looses the game. 
STRESS BALL has a very minimalistic layout. It is design for an older audience or young children.

## MVP
- Game screen with a ball moving to random places and a timer to track the minutes/seconds of the game
- the background alternates between two colors to make a more stressful environment for the user
- Increasing dificulty
- When user looses, show score (number of clicks)
